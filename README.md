# ACM Phoenix 2.0
Welcome to the readme for phoenix2. 

If you have any questions, feel free to contact the original author, Kyle Minshall.  
He can be reached at `kyleminshall@gmail.com`. 

## Overview
The project is written in Symfony 3 which is the latest major version of the best web framework for PHP. 

Main things to know: 

* Views: `app/Resources/views`
* Controllers: `src/AppBundle/Controllers`
* Web root: `web`

To run Symfony tools/scripts, run the command `php bin/console <command> <flags>` in your terminal of choice. 

## Development

First, you need to install [composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx).  
Composer is a package manager for PHP. We use a few packages.  

Second, you are going to need a SQL database. We use MySQL on prod but we also use an ORM for all our our entity stuff. 

1. Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:acm-ucr/phoenix2.git`
2. `cd` into the newly created phoenix2 directory
3.
